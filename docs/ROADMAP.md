## Next up — integrations to finish

### Engineering integrations
- [x] Cross-sections tool auto-pulls from project levelling data
  - Reuses `GET /api/project/[id]/points` (filter points with elevation along chainage)
  - `/tools/cross-sections?project=<id>` auto-populates via `ProjectCrossSections` component
- [x] Earthworks tool auto-pulls from cross-sections
  - New API: `GET /api/project/[id]/cross-sections` — groups survey points by chainage (parsed from point name), supports optional `?interval=N` binning
  - `/tools/earthworks?project=<id>` auto-populates existing ground profiles via `ProjectCrossSections`

### Mutation plan deep integration
- [ ] Refactor `MutationPlanGenerator` to accept `initialPlots` prop
  - Currently uses sessionStorage bridge (works but fragile)
  - Clean prop injection is the right pattern

## Excellence features (from Gemini brainstorm, prioritized)

### Tier 1 — build next (high value, feasible)

#### ArdhiSasa/NLIMS pre-flight topological validator
**Why:** Surveyors get files rejected for sliver polygons, self-intersections, adjoiner overlaps. Pre-flight validation saves real hours. Sticky feature.
**How:** turf.js + jsts for topology checks. Block save on invalid geometry. Export with exact NLIMS attribute schema.
**Where:** `/cadastral-workflow` step 2 (boundary validate), plus standalone `/tools/topology-check`
**Effort:** 1 session
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `/tools/topology-check`, 9 validation rules, turf.js engine

#### COGO deed plan reconstructor
**Why:** Historical paper deed plans list bearings/distances, not coordinates. Surveyors need to digitize these without AutoCAD.
**How:** Parser for DMS bearings + distances → compute ΔE/ΔN → OpenLayers LineString/Polygon. "Swing & scale" tool to snap onto known control.
**Where:** `/tools/cogo` (extend existing) or new `/tools/cogo-reconstruct`
**Effort:** 1-2 sessions
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `/tools/cogo-reconstruct`, WCB + quadrant formats, swing & scale transform

#### As-built deviation guard (engineering)
**Why:** KeNHA tolerances are strict. Catching deviations early saves rework.
**How:** Linear referencing on design centerline. Compare as-built points vs design elevation. Green/amber/red visual feedback.
**Where:** `/engineering-workflow` step 6 (as-built), or `/tools/setting-out` extension
**Effort:** 1-2 sessions
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `/tools/as-built-deviation`, KeNHA tolerance presets, linear interpolation

#### Generative lot subdivision & road network allocator (cadastral)
**Why:** Subdividing a 10ha parcel into 50×100 plots with road reserves takes days in CAD. Algorithmic generation in seconds + beacon list output is the highest-impact premium feature.
**How:** Parent polygon input → road spine placement → sweeping-line slice perpendicular to spine → child polygons → beacon coordinates. NOT Voronoi (irregular plots) — must produce standard rectangular plots (50×100, 100×100).
**Where:** New `/tools/subdivision-generator` or extend `/components/subdivision/SubdivisionPanel`
**Effort:** 2-3 sessions for core engine
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `/tools/subdivision-generator`, Kenya plot presets, beacon CSV export

### Geodesy features (from Gemini "deep tech" analysis)

#### Combined Scale Factor (grid-to-ground area conversion)
**Why:** At Nairobi (1,798m elevation), a 100ha parcel has ~0.03ha discrepancy between grid area (UTM coordinates) and true ground area (physical surface). The deed plan must state ground area.
**How:** CSF = k × Fh (grid scale factor × elevation factor). Ground Area = Grid Area / CSF².
**Where:** `/tools/scale-factor`
**Effort:** 1 session
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — Kenya location presets, two conversion modes (direct + polygon), legal note

#### Helmert 7-Parameter Site Calibration (WGS84 ↔ Arc 1960)
**Why:** RTK rovers output WGS84. Survey of Kenya registry uses Arc 1960 (Clarke 1880 ellipsoid). Horizontal shift is 100-200m without transformation. This is Kenya's "silent killer."
**How:** 7-parameter similarity transformation (Tx, Ty, Tz, Rx, Ry, Rz, Scale) from 3+ control point pairs. Least squares for 4+ points.
**Where:** `/tools/site-calibration`
**Effort:** 2 sessions
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — Helmert engine, RMS residual analysis, batch transform, color-coded border inputs

#### Orthometric Height Conversion (EGM96 geoid)
**Why:** GNSS gives ellipsoidal height (above WGS84 ellipsoid). Engineering needs orthometric height (above sea level / geoid). Water flows by gravity (geoid), not ellipsoid. At Nairobi, correction is ~10m.
**How:** H = h - N. EGM96 5° grid with bilinear interpolation. Client-side, no external file.
**Where:** `/tools/orthometric-height`
**Effort:** 1 session
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — Single + batch modes, Kenya geoid reference table, CSV export, engineering note

#### Error Ellipse Visualization (95% confidence)
**Why:** LSA engine already computes error ellipses (semi-major, semi-minor, orientation). Surveyors need to see them visually to assess network quality. Military-grade software rejects circular error approximations.
**How:** SVG ellipse rendering in LSA results, scaled to fit, color-coded by threshold (green ≤20mm, amber 20-40mm, red >40mm). North arrow for orientation reference.
**Where:** `/tools/lsa` (inline in results)
**Effort:** 1 session
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — SVG ellipses with 95% confidence, per-station visualization, legend

### Tier 2 — build when needed (real but niche)

#### Dual-surface TIN volume comparison (topographic/engineering)
**How:** Extend existing `src/lib/engine/contours.ts` `computeVolumeFromTIN` to accept two TIN surfaces. Prismoidal column equation: `V = A_base × (Δz1+Δz2+Δz3)/3`. Cut/fill heatmap overlay on OpenLayers.
**Where:** Extend `/tools/earthworks` or new `/tools/volume-comparison` (route exists)
**Effort:** 1 session (extends existing volume code)
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `/tools/volume-comparison` is live with TIN and IDW grid methods, cut/fill volume computation via `computeVolumeBetweenSurfaces`, CSV export for both summary report and cut/fill grid, and a cut/fill heatmap visualization. Two-surface input via file upload (CSV/XYZ/TXT) with side-by-side comparison.

#### Parabolic vertical curve profile designer (engineering)
**Why:** Highway alignment audit — checking crest/sag curves against stopping sight distance (SSD).
**How:** Parabolic curve equation `y = ((g2-g1)/2L)x² + g1·x + E_PVC`. K-factor check against design speed. Amber warning on failing curves.
**Where:** New `/tools/vertical-curve` or fold into as-built deviation guard as "design compliance" mode
**Effort:** 1 session
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `/tools/vertical-curve-designer`, multi-VIP alignment engine, AASHTO K-factor + SSD compliance, SVG profile diagram, station table, CSV export. Engine: `src/lib/survey/curves/verticalCurveDesigner.ts` (31 tests passing).

#### Web Worker TIN generator
**Why:** Contour generation can freeze on large datasets.
**How:** Move Delaunay triangulation + contour interpolation to Web Worker.
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `src/lib/workers/tinWorker.ts` + `tinWorkerClient.ts` with auto-fallback to sync engine when Workers unavailable. Promise-based API (`triangulateAsync`, `buildTINSurfaceAsync`, `generateContoursAsync`) with progress callbacks. 13 tests passing.

#### Automated breakline extraction
**Why:** Auto-draw toe-of-slope, top-of-bank from TIN mesh.
**How:** Compute triangle normal vectors, flag sharp angle changes, stitch into MultiLineString.
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `src/lib/engine/breaklineExtraction.ts` (triangle-normal dihedral algorithm, polyline stitching, ridge/slope-change/minor classification, GeoJSON + Breakline[] export). Integrated into `BreaklineEditor` as a new "Auto" tab with threshold slider and live preview. 20 tests passing.

#### Spiral-to-curve alignment engine
**Why:** KeNHA highway design uses clothoid spirals.
**How:** Custom OpenLayers geometry for transition spirals. Dynamic chainage stationing.
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED — `src/lib/survey/curves/spiralAlignment.ts` (TS→SC→CS→ST stationing, clothoid series expansion, world-coordinate output, station interpolation). UI: new "Spiral Alignment" tab on `/tools/curves` with SVG plan diagram and station table. 29 tests passing.

### Tier 3 — don't build (flawed or trap)

#### Web Bluetooth NTRIP client
**Why not:** Wrong Bluetooth stack (SPP vs GATT), wrong router (Pages vs App), Chromium-only, 3-month R&D trap. Metardu already has `NTRIPClientPanel` — use native Bluetooth, not Web Bluetooth API.

## Technical debt

### NextAuth v4 → v5 migration
- Config ready (`src/lib/auth-v5.ts`)
- Codemod ready (`scripts/auth-v5-codemod.js`, 44 files identified)
- Timeline: 2-week side-quest when there's a quiet window
- Blocker: needs Prisma schema migration + E2E test cycle

### Tool page deep refits
- PageHeader + card CSS updated globally (shipped)
- Individual tool pages still use old internal layouts
- Priority: traverse, levelling, COGO, deed plan (highest traffic)
- Pattern: field-book table + output diagram (from v0.1 preview)

### OKLCH color migration
- Current tokens are hex
- impeccable skill recommends OKLCH for perceptual uniformity
- Low priority — current palette works

### Prisma schema cleanup
- SurveyType union still includes 'mining' | 'hydrographic' (backward compat)
- DB tables for hydro/mining may still exist (no migration run)
- Clean up after confirming no old projects reference them

---

## Infrastructure

### Redis cache for calculators
- System design doc prescribes cache-aside for deterministic calculator results
- Needs Redis instance
- Expected 60-80% cache hit rate
- Build when QPS justifies it

### BullMQ async sync queue
- Current offline queue is synchronous (FIFO on reconnect)
- Parallel processing for large queues
- Build when queue depth > 1000 typical

### Multi-region deployment
- Single region fine for Kenya
- Build when expanding beyond East Africa

---

## Internal skills (meta)

### Capture Metardu conventions as skills
- Use `anthropics/skills/skill-creator` framework
- Document: Prisma schema patterns, calculator input validation, offline sync rules
- Progressive disclosure: SKILL.md ≤500 lines, references for depth
- Low priority — internal documentation, not user-facing
