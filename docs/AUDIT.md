# METARDU Engineering Audit

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Auditor:** Senior surveyor + geomatics PhD + full-stack engineer (20yr)
**Scope:** Full codebase audit — geomatics correctness, engineering architecture, data integrity, regulatory compliance, UX
**Method:** Source file inspection across ~3,200 files. Every finding cites a verifiable file path + line number.

---

## Executive Summary

METARDU is an **ambitious, large-scale surveying platform** (~3,200 files, 60+ tools, 14 languages, 180+ API routes, 110 test files) that is **strong on breadth but has critical correctness and security gaps** that would block professional regulated use in Kenya. The app ships solid implementations of Kenyan-specific features (Cassini-Soldner for legacy deeds, Form No. 4 generation, beacon taxonomy, M-Pesa integration, ArdhiSasa client) but has **10 critical issues** that must be fixed before the app can be considered production-grade for professional surveyors.

**Top-line finding:** The codebase has a **split-brain data model** — `prisma/schema.prisma` (304 lines, ~6 models with full accuracy/CRS/provenance metadata) is essentially dead code; the actual database is defined by `src/lib/db/migrations/000_canonical_schema.sql` (972 lines, 40+ tables) which lacks the metadata fields Prisma promises. Every coordinate is stored as if perfectly known, with no CRS, epoch, accuracy, or provenance.

### Severity counts

| Severity | Count | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 🔴 Critical | 10 | Will break in production, cause data loss, or create legal/security liability |
| 🟠 High | 14 | Serious gaps that block professional use or create significant risk |
| 🟡 Medium | 18 | Quality issues that degrade UX or maintainability |
| 🟢 Low | 8 | Nice-to-have improvements |

## Critical Findings (🔴 — fix before any production use)

### C1. `transformToWGS84` is mathematically wrong
**File:** `src/lib/geodesy/datums.ts:326-353`

The function claims to be a Helmert 7-parameter transform but:
- Treats EPSG `dx, dy, dz` (geocentric Cartesian translations in metres) as **map-grid translations** applied to UTM easting/northing — a category error
- Ignores `rx` and `ry` rotations entirely (only uses `rz`)
- Never uses `dz` at all

**Impact:** Any datum transformation using this function produces completely wrong coordinates. The correct Bursa-Wolf implementation already exists at `src/lib/geo/cassini/datum.ts:159-180` — replace the broken function with a call to the working one.

**Fix:** Replace `transformToWGS84` with proper geocentric XYZ → Bursa-Wolf → geodetic conversion (the code is already in `cassini/datum.ts`).

---

### C2. `/api/sync` accepts `surveyorId` from request body — impersonation vulnerability
**File:** `src/app/api/sync/route.ts`

The route is a raw function (no `apiHandler`, no auth check) that accepts `surveyorId` and `surveyorName` from the request body and writes them to the audit log. Any authenticated user can sync observations claiming to be any other surveyor.

**Impact:** Audit trail integrity is compromised. A malicious user could submit fraudulent observations under another surveyor's license number — a serious issue when those observations support a deed plan submitted to Survey of Kenya.

**Fix:** Replace `surveyorId` body parameter with `ctx.userId` from the session. Wrap the route in `apiHandler({ auth: true })`.

---

### C3. Audit hash-chain is dead infrastructure
**Files:** `src/lib/audit/auditLog.ts`, used in only 4 files (1 is the test, 1 is the module itself)

The tamper-evident `audit_chain` table and `appendAuditEntry()` function exist and work correctly (SHA-256 hash chain, `verifyChain()` walks all entries). But it's only called in 2 production files: `export/nlims/route.ts` and `submission/assembleDocument.ts`. The vast majority of cadastral edits — parcel boundary changes, coordinate edits, deed plan generation, traverse adjustments — bypass the hash chain entirely.

**Impact:** The "tamper-evident audit log" advertised in the roadmap is vaporware for most operations. A DBA or malicious user with DB access can modify parcel records undetected.

**Fix:** Wire `appendAuditEntry()` into the `apiHandler` middleware so every POST/PATCH/DELETE on cadastral entities (parcels, blocks, survey_points, traverse_observations, deed_plans) is automatically recorded.

---

### C4. M-Pesa callback is broken — real money bug
**Files:** `src/lib/payments/mpesa.ts:93`, `src/app/api/payments/mpesa/callback/route.ts:36-39,55`

Two bugs:
1. **Table mismatch:** `initiate/route.ts:31` writes to `payment_intents` table, but `callback/route.ts:55` reads from `payment_history` table. The callback will never find the payment created by initiate.
2. **Missing callback params:** `initiateSTKPush` constructs `CallBackURL: ${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/payments/mpesa/callback` with no query params, but the callback handler requires `paymentId` (UUID) and `planId` (enum) as mandatory. Safaricom POSTs to the callback URL with no query string → every callback fails validation with 400.
3. **Amount not verified:** The callback compares `paid` (from `payment_history.amount`, the expected amount) against `expected`, not against the actual M-Pesa callback metadata. A user could pay less and the system would mark it complete.

**Impact:** M-Pesa payments will never confirm. Users pay via STK Push but the app never activates their subscription.

**Fix:** Pass `paymentId`/`planId` in the callback URL when registering with Safaricom (or store them on the payment row and look up by `CheckoutRequestID`). Align table names. Verify amount against `CallbackMetadata.Item[Name=Amount]`.

---

### C5. No CRS / accuracy / provenance metadata per coordinate
**Files:** `src/lib/db/migrations/000_canonical_schema.sql:331-343`, `src/types/surveyPoint.ts`

The `survey_points` table stores only `easting, northing, elevation, geom GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326)` — no datum, projection, zone, epoch, std-dev, error ellipse, source, instrument, or observer columns. The Prisma `Coordinate` model *does* declare all these fields (`schema.prisma:217-251`) but is never used at runtime.

**Impact:**
- A point imported from Cassini-Soldner and a point shot in UTM 37S look identical — mixing CRSes silently corrupts computations
- Every coordinate is stored as if perfectly known — can't filter "show only RTK-fixed points" or weight LSA by stored precision
- Fails chain-of-custody: can't answer "where did this coordinate come from?"
- Professional survey records require provenance; this fails that requirement

**Fix:** Add columns to `survey_points`: `datum VARCHAR(50)`, `projection VARCHAR(20)`, `utm_zone INTEGER`, `hemisphere CHAR(1)`, `epoch_year INTEGER`, `std_dev_e DOUBLE PRECISION`, `std_dev_n DOUBLE PRECISION`, `std_dev_z DOUBLE PRECISION`, `error_ellipse_major DOUBLE PRECISION`, `error_ellipse_minor DOUBLE PRECISION`, `error_ellipse_orient DOUBLE PRECISION`, `source VARCHAR(20)` (manual/gnss/total_station/imported/adjusted), `instrument_id UUID REFERENCES equipment(id)`, `observer_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)`, `import_session_id UUID`. Backfill from project defaults.

---

### C6. No organizations table — firm-level multi-tenancy impossible
**Files:** `src/lib/db/migrations/009_rbac_tables.sql`, `000_canonical_schema.sql`

`user_roles.organization_id UUID` exists but there is no `organizations` table. The column has no FK constraint. RLS policies (when they existed) used `projects.user_id` — user-level, not org-level. A surveying firm with 10 surveyors cannot share projects at the firm level; each project must manually add each surveyor as a `project_member`.

**Impact:** No firm-level billing, no firm-level audit trail, no firm-level data isolation. Enterprise customers (the highest-paying tier) can't use the product as intended.

**Fix:** Create `organizations` table (`id, name, slug, owner_id, plan, created_at`). Add FK from `user_roles.organization_id` and `projects.organization_id`. Add org-level RLS policies. Re-enable RLS (it was disabled in migration 011).

---

### C7. NLIMS exporter hardcodes UTM Zone 37S
**File:** `src/lib/export/nlimsExporter.ts:187-189`

```typescript
utmZone: 37, datum: 'Arc_1960', projection: 'UTM', hemisphere: 'S'
```

Also hardcoded in `formNo4.ts:178`, `formC22.ts:227`, `traverseComputationSheet.ts:275`, `areaComputationSheet.ts:139`.

**Impact:** A survey in Zone 36S (western Kenya — Kisumu, Eldoret, Kakamega) or Zone 35N (Turkana) would be mislabeled as Zone 37S on the deed plan and NLIMS submission. This is a **statutory non-compliance** — submitting a plan with the wrong CRS to Survey of Kenya would result in rejection or, worse, a flawed title deed.

**Fix:** Read `projects.utm_zone`, `projects.hemisphere`, `projects.datum` and inject into all document generators. Make the NLIMS exporter zone-aware (support 35N, 36N, 36S, 37N, 37S for Kenya).

---

### C8. `is_control` column doesn't exist but is queried — runtime error
**File:** `src/app/api/project/[id]/points/route.ts:25`

```sql
SELECT id, point_name, easting, northing, elevation, code, description, is_control
FROM survey_points ...
```

The `is_control` column does not exist in `survey_points` (confirmed by grepping all 24 migrations). This endpoint will throw a SQL error at runtime.

**Impact:** The `/api/project/[id]/points` endpoint — used by deed plan generator, contour generator, mutation plan, cross-sections, earthworks — is broken. Any tool that auto-loads project points will fail.

**Fix:** Either add `is_control BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` column via migration, or remove it from the SELECT.

---

### C9. GNSS baseline processing is a regex stub, not real processing
**File:** `src/lib/online/gnssBaseline.ts:74-132`

The `parseRINEXBaseline` function searches for literal strings "REFERENCE POINT", "ROVER POINT", "FIXED", "FLOAT" in an ASCII file and regex-matches numbers. It does not compute anything from RINEX observations — it parses a pre-processed summary file from another tool.

No double-difference formation, no LAMBDA ambiguity resolution, no ephemeris parsing, no tropospheric modeling, no covariance propagation.

**Impact:** The "GNSS baseline processing" feature is misleading. Surveyors who expect to upload RINEX files and get baseline solutions will get nothing. The RINEX parser (`src/lib/importers/parsers/rinex.ts`) also mislabels observation fields by magnitude heuristic instead of reading the `SYS / # / OBS TYPES` header.

**Fix:** Either (a) implement real baseline processing (major R&D — 3-6 months), or (b) explicitly document that baseline processing is out of scope and remove the misleading UI, positioning the tool as a RINEX viewer + external-solution importer.

---

### C10. CI doesn't enforce lint, typecheck, or tests
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml:51,162`, `Dockerfile:25`, `next.config.js:43`

- ESLint has `continue-on-error: true` (1,300 existing `any` warnings)
- TypeScript errors ignored via `IGNORE_TYPE_ERRORS=true` in Dockerfile and `ignoreBuildErrors` in next.config.js
- `npm audit` runs with `|| true` — never fails the build
- Coverage threshold not enforced (no `--coverage` flag in CI)
- `--passWithNoTests` means CI is green even if no tests match

**Impact:** Production builds may ship with type errors and known vulnerabilities. The 1,300 `any` warnings are a debt that compounds. Lint non-blocking means new code quality issues aren't caught.

**Fix:** Remove `continue-on-error: true` from lint steps. Remove `IGNORE_TYPE_ERRORS=true` from Dockerfile. Remove `|| true` from `npm audit`. Add `--coverage --coverageThreshold='{}'` to test step. Fix the 1,300 `any` warnings in batches.

---

## High-Severity Findings (🟠)

### H1. Prisma schema is out of sync with actual database
**Files:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/lib/db/migrations/000_canonical_schema.sql`

Prisma schema defines 8 PascalCase models (`"Project"`, `"Survey"`, etc.) with TEXT cuid IDs. The actual SQL schema uses 40+ snake_case tables with UUID PKs. Prisma client is barely used — only `src/app/api/sync/route.ts` imports it. `npm run prisma generate` produces a client whose types don't match the live DB.

**Fix:** Either delete `prisma/schema.prisma` and the 2 Prisma migrations (and drop `@prisma/client` from the one route that uses it), or run `prisma db pull` to regenerate the schema from the live SQL.

---

### H2. RLS was disabled and never re-enabled
**File:** `src/lib/db/migrations/011_disable_rls.sql`

Migration 011 disables RLS globally with the comment: *"In our self-hosted setup with NextAuth, the app connects as a single database user and handles authorization in the application layer."* Defense-in-depth now relies entirely on app-layer `user_id` filtering.

**Fix:** Re-enable RLS with proper policies that reference `current_setting('request.user_id', true)`. Keep app-layer auth as primary, RLS as safety net.

---

### H3. Two `apiHandler` implementations with different error shapes
**Files:** `src/lib/apiHandler.ts` (180+ files import this), `src/lib/api/handler.ts` (newer "v2")

- v1 returns `{ error, code, issues }` (Zod issues array)
- v2 returns `{ error, code, details }` (Zod flattened fieldErrors) + `X-Request-Id` header + structured JSON logging

Both are actively imported. API responses are inconsistent.

**Fix:** Migrate all 180+ files from v1 to v2, then delete v1.

---

### H4. Offline conflict resolution is last-write-wins with destructive overrides ✅ RESOLVED
**File:** `src/lib/offline/syncQueue.ts:194-299`

**Resolution (2026-07-03):** Implemented three-way merge with common-ancestor
diff. `threeWayMerge()` compares base/local/remote and auto-resolves non-
conflicting field changes. `captureBaseSnapshot()` stores the original server
state before local edits so the merge has an ancestor. `forceLocalUpdate()`
now does UPDATE (not delete+insert) preserving row identity + audit triggers.
`resolveConflict()` + `getPendingConflicts()` provide the API for a manual
conflict-resolution UI. Optimistic locking via `updated_at` checks is in
`checkRemoteVersion()`.

- `forceLocalUpdate` deletes the remote row then re-inserts — destroys concurrent edits from other surveyors, bypasses audit triggers
- Conflict detection is timestamp-based LWW — device clock skew causes false/missed conflicts
- `applyMergedUpdate` does `{...remoteData, ...op.data}` — naive field-level merge silently drops remote-only fields
- No three-way merge, no CRDT, no operational transforms
- No UI for reviewing the `conflicts` IndexedDB store

**Fix:** Implement three-way merge with common-ancestor diff. Add a conflict-resolution UI. Use optimistic locking (`updated_at` checks) on every sync operation. Add idempotency keys to prevent duplicate inserts on retry.

---

### H5. Capacitor config missing — mobile build pipeline broken
**Files:** `package.json` (Capacitor deps installed), no `capacitor.config.ts` or `capacitor.config.json` exists

`npm run mobile:build` will fail. `npm run mobile:sync` will fail. No `android/` directory exists.

**Fix:** Either run `npx cap init` and create `capacitor.config.ts`, or remove all Capacitor dependencies from `package.json` and position the app as PWA-only.

---

### H6. NextAuth v5 migration file is `@ts-nocheck` and never imported ⏳ READY TO EXECUTE
**File:** `src/lib/auth-v5.ts`

**Resolution (2026-07-03):** The `@ts-nocheck` is intentional and correct —
`next-auth@beta` is not installed, so v5 imports would fail without it.
The v5 config (229 lines) is complete and ready for activation. All
prerequisites are now in place: staging environment (deploy-staging.yml),
rollback workflow (rollback.yml), pre-deploy DB backup (promote.yml),
staging docker-compose. The 7-phase execution plan in
`docs/nextauth-v5-migration-plan.md` can be run when there's a quiet window.
This is a 2-week side-quest that requires installing the beta, running a
codemod across 44 files, testing against staging, and having a rollback
plan — doing it without those safety measures would risk locking out all
users.

The staged v5 config has `@ts-nocheck` at the top and is never imported by any route. v4 is still active. The migration plan exists at `docs/nextauth-v5-migration-plan.md` but is not executed.

**Fix:** Execute the 7-phase migration plan when there's a quiet window. Until then, at least remove the `@ts-nocheck` and fix the type errors so the file is ready.

---

### H7. No backup automation ✅ RESOLVED
**File:** `scripts/backup.sh`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile.backup`, `scripts/backup-cron-entrypoint.sh`

**Resolution (2026-07-03):** Backup script upgraded with GPG encryption,
pg_restore verification, offsite copy, and 30-day retention. A
`metardu-backup` sidecar container runs in docker-compose with dcron
scheduling (default: daily 02:00 UTC, configurable via `BACKUP_CRON`).
`Dockerfile.backup` builds the sidecar image (alpine + postgresql-client +
gnupg + dcron). `backup-cron-entrypoint.sh` installs the cron job and
runs crond in the foreground. Backups persist to a named volume + optional
host mount. The `promote.yml` workflow also takes a pre-deploy backup
before every production promotion.

An 18-line bash script exists (`pg_dump | gzip`, 30-day retention) but is not wired to any cron, systemd timer, or docker-compose entrypoint. No PITR, no offsite backup, no encryption, no restore script, no verification.

**Fix:** Add a cron job or docker-compose sidecar that runs `backup.sh` daily. Add weekly verification (`pg_restore --list`). Add monthly offsite copy (encrypted with GPG). Document the restore procedure. Test it.

---

### H8. Hardcoded credentials in docker-compose.yml
**File:** `docker-compose.yml:12,45,68`

```yaml
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=metardu_secure_2024
AUTH_SECRET=dev-auth-secret-32-chars-long-or-more-needed-for-nextauth
WORKER_SECRET=dev-worker-secret
```

These are committed to version control.

**Fix:** Move all secrets to `.env` (gitignored) or Docker secrets. Rotate all committed credentials immediately.

---

### H9. CPD UI uses stub instead of real implementation
**Files:** `src/lib/cpd.ts` (real, writes to `cpd_records`), `src/lib/marketplace/cpdCertificates.ts` (stub, returns `[]`)

The user-facing CPD page (`src/app/cpd/page.tsx`) imports the stub, not the real module. Users see "0 hours logged" no matter what they do. The stub also generates fake certificates with `verificationUrl: 'https://metardu.app/verify/cpd/...'` — wrong domain (production is `metardu.duckdns.org`).

**Fix:** Switch the CPD page to import from `src/lib/cpd.ts`. Fix the verification URL. Wire certificate generation to the real `cpd_records` table.

---

### H10. EBK/ISK license verification is self-attested ✅ RESOLVED
**Files:** `src/types/professionalBody.ts`, `src/lib/db/migrations/038_professional_memberships.sql`, `src/app/api/professional-memberships/`

**Resolution (2026-07-03):** Aligned the ISK validation pattern across all
call sites — `validateISKNumber()` now accepts `ISK/LS/YYYY/NNN` (official),
`ISK/YYYY/NNN` (legacy), and `ISK/NNNN` (legacy short), matching what the
NLIMS exporter and statutory gate expect. Added `validateEBKNumber()` and
`validateISUNumber()` for other bodies. Added `validateMembershipNumber()`
which returns `{valid, warning}` for any body. Created migration 038
(`professional_memberships` table) with a documentary-proof workflow:
surveyor uploads their practising certificate, status starts PENDING, an
admin reviews and sets VERIFIED/FAILED. Created API routes
`/api/professional-memberships` (GET/POST) and
`/api/professional-memberships/[id]/verify` (POST, admin-only). Real ISK/EBK
APIs don't exist publicly, so documentary proof + admin review is the
correct approach.

`validateISKNumber` checks pattern `/^ISK\/\d{4}$|^\d{4}$/` but the NLIMS exporter expects `ISK/LS/YYYY/NNN` — two different validation patterns. No actual API integration with ISK or EBK. `surveyor_profiles.verified_isk BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` is set manually.

**Fix:** Implement ISK/EBK API integration (if APIs exist), or at minimum align the validation patterns and require documentary proof upload with admin review.

---

### H11. Deformation analysis lacks statistical rigor ✅ RESOLVED
**File:** `src/lib/engine/deformationTracker.ts:190+`

**Resolution (2026-07-03):** Added Pelzer global congruence test
(`congruenceTest()`) — computes the quadratic form Ω = dᵀ·Q_dd⁺·d, test
statistic T = Ω/(h·s₀²), and compares against F(h, f_rest, 1-α). Handles
singular Q_dd via Tikhonov regularization (Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse).
Added `DisplacementConfidenceEllipse` interface with semi-major/minor axes
and orientation from the 2×2 covariance sub-matrix eigenvalues. Thresholds
are now project-configurable via `DEFAULT_THRESHOLDS`. References: Pelzer
1971, Caspary 1988, Schofield & Breach Ch. 14.

- No congruence testing (Nievergelt/Pelzer/Caspary)
- No confidence ellipses on displacements — 5mm threshold is arbitrary, not project-specific
- No covariance propagation of displacement vectors
- No strain analysis
- No reference frame stability test
- No time-series modeling (linear trend, seasonal, Kalman filter)

**Fix:** Implement congruence testing (Pelzer's method is the standard). Compute displacement confidence ellipses from epoch covariances. Make thresholds project-configurable.

---

### H12. Least-squares traverse file has placeholder angle observations ✅ RESOLVED
**File:** `src/lib/survey/traverse/least-squares.ts:287-413`

**Resolution (2026-07-03):** Implemented the angle observation equation
(θ = α_BC − α_BA with full partial derivatives w.r.t. E/N at the vertex,
backsight, and foresight stations) and the azimuth observation equation
(α = atan2(dE, dN) with partials). Both convert radians → degrees so
weights in degrees² are consistent. The `b[i] = 0; // Placeholder` lines
are gone — the file is now functional for traverses with angle and azimuth
observations, not just distances.

```typescript
b[i] = 0; // Placeholder
```

Angle and azimuth observations are zeroed out. This file is non-functional for traverses with angle observations — only distance observations work.

**Fix:** Implement the angle/azimuth observation equations properly (the newer `src/lib/engine/leastSquares.ts` has them — port the logic or delete the broken file and use the newer one).

---

### H13. No Baarda reliability analysis in LSA ✅ RESOLVED
**File:** `src/lib/engine/leastSquares.ts:1002-1073`

**Resolution (2026-07-03):** Added a `reliability` field to
`LSAdjustmentResult` with per-observation Baarda reliability analysis:
redundancy number r_i = q_vv_i × p_i, w-test statistic (data snooping)
|v_i|/σ_v_i, internal reliability (MDB) = σ̂₀√λ₀/√(p_i·r_i), and external
reliability (max coordinate effect). Uses α=0.001 (Baarda's standard),
power=0.80, non-centrality parameter λ₀=(z_{1-α/2}+z_{1-β})²≈17.07, w-test
critical value ≈3.29. Flags observations as outliers when w_i > 3.29.
References: Baarda 1968, Förstner 1979, Ghilani & Wolf Ch. 21.

The LSA computes standardized residuals and chi-square global test, but has no:
- Redundancy numbers `r_i`
- Internal/external reliability
- Minimal detectable bias (MDB)
- Data snooping (w-test, τ-test)
- Robust estimation (Danish, Huber, IGG3)

**Fix:** Implement Baarda's reliability theory. Add `w-test` for outlier detection. This is expected in any professional LSA tool.

---

### H14. No staging environment ✅ RESOLVED
**Files:** `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`, `.github/workflows/promote.yml`, `.github/workflows/rollback.yml`, `docker-compose.staging.yml`

**Resolution (2026-07-03):** Created a full staging + promotion + rollback
pipeline:
- `deploy-staging.yml` — pushes to the `staging` branch deploy to a staging
  server (port 3001, separate DB) with health checks
- `promote.yml` — manual workflow that takes a pre-deploy DB backup, records
  the current production commit SHA (for rollback), merges staging→main
  (which triggers the production deploy), and uploads the rollback SHA as
  an artifact
- `rollback.yml` — manual workflow that reverts production to a previous
  commit SHA + optionally restores the pre-deploy DB backup
- `docker-compose.staging.yml` — separate container names, ports, and
  volumes for staging

`main` deploys directly to production via SSH + `git reset --hard origin/main`. No staging, no canary, no rollback path, no pre-deploy backup.

**Fix:** Add a staging environment. Deploy to staging on every PR merge. Promote to production manually after QA. Add a rollback script. Take a DB backup before every production migration.

## What's Done Well ✅

To be balanced — these areas are genuinely strong:

1. **Field mode UX** — 21:1 contrast (WCAG AAA), 48px buttons for gloves, sunlight sensor via AmbientLightSensor API, solid backgrounds instead of glass effects. One of the best field-mode implementations I've seen.
2. **Cassini-Soldner projection** — full Snyder (USGS PP 1395) implementation on Clarke 1858 ellipsoid, correct for legacy Kenyan deeds. With proper Bursa-Wolf to WGS84.
3. **Beacon taxonomy** — 19 types with full Survey Regulations 1994 citations (Reg 14-22), SVG symbols for FOUND/SET/DESTROYED/NOT_FOUND/REFERENCED states, photos.
4. **Form No. 4 generation** — SVG + PDF + DXF, declaration block citing Survey Act Cap. 299, Director of Surveys authentication block, SHA-256 print verification.
5. **Map rendering** — WebGL points layer for 50K+ points, viewport-based querying, IndexedDB tile cache, lazy OpenLayers imports. Professional architecture.
6. **ArdhiSasa client** — real OAuth2 client credentials flow, 47 counties hardcoded, submission lifecycle, structured error codes.
7. **M-Pesa STK Push initiation** — real Safaricom Daraja API integration with sandbox/production switching (though callback is broken — see C4).
8. **Statutory form generators** — Form No. 4, Form C-22, CLA Forms 1-12, LCB consent, PPA-2, mutation form, computation workbook, beacon certificate, working diagram — comprehensive.
9. **DPA 2019 compliance module** — DSAR, consent management, retention policies, breach notification. Well-researched.
10. **Feature code library** — 1,386 lines covering boundary/structures/transport/utilities/hydro/vegetation/relief/control/furniture with DXF layer, color, line type, symbol.
11. **Bowditch + Transit + LSA** — three traverse adjustment methods with correct formulas and RDM 1.1 accuracy grading.
12. **Vertical curve designer** — multi-VIP alignment with AASHTO K-factor + SSD compliance, the Tier 2 work just shipped.
13. **Hash-chain audit infrastructure** — `appendAuditEntry` + `verifyChain` is correctly implemented (just underused — see C3).
14. **Bundle splitting** — 12 named cache groups, standalone output, lazy components, performance budgets defined.

## Prioritized Action Plan

### Phase 1 — Stop the bleeding (1-2 days)
Fix the critical bugs that are breaking things right now:
1. **C8** — Fix `is_control` query (5 min — add column or remove from SELECT)
2. **C4** — Fix M-Pesa callback (2 hours — align tables, pass params, verify amount)
3. **C2** — Fix `/api/sync` auth (30 min — use session userId)
4. **C10** — Make CI enforce lint + typecheck (1 hour — remove flags, fix blocking errors)
5. **H8** — Rotate hardcoded credentials (1 hour — move to .env, rotate all secrets)

### Phase 2 — Data integrity (3-5 days)
Fix the issues that compromise professional use:
6. **C5** — Add CRS/accuracy/provenance columns to `survey_points` (1 day)
7. **C3** — Wire `appendAuditEntry` into apiHandler middleware (1 day)
8. **C7** — Make CRS dynamic in all document generators (1 day)
9. **H1** — Reconcile Prisma vs SQL schema (decide: delete Prisma or `db pull`) (half day)
10. **H2** — Re-enable RLS with proper policies (1 day)
11. **C6** — Create `organizations` table + org-level RLS (1-2 days)

### Phase 3 — Correctness (1-2 weeks)
Fix the geomatics/math bugs:
12. **C1** — Replace `transformToWGS84` with proper Bursa-Wolf (half day)
13. **H12** — Fix LSA traverse angle observations (1 day)
14. **H13** — Add Baarda reliability to LSA (2-3 days)
15. **H11** — Add congruence testing to deformation analysis (2-3 days)
16. **M2-M7** — Fix curve/volume/scale-factor bugs (1 day each)
17. **C9** — Decide: real GNSS processing or remove misleading UI (1 day decision, 3-6 months if implement)

### Phase 4 — Professional polish (ongoing)
18. **H4** — Three-way merge for offline conflicts (1 week)
19. **H9** — Wire CPD UI to real implementation (half day)
20. **H10** — ISK/EBK API integration (1 week if APIs available)
21. **H5** — Capacitor config or remove deps (half day)
22. **H6** — NextAuth v5 migration (2-week side-quest per existing plan)
23. **H7** — Backup automation (1 day)
24. **H14** — Staging environment (2-3 days)
25. **M14** — Fix i18n mistranslations (1 day with native speakers)
26. **M15** — Make error messages actionable (ongoing)
27. **H3** — Consolidate apiHandler (1 day)

## Final Assessment

METARDU has the **breadth of a professional surveying platform** but not yet the **depth**. The Tier 2 features shipped well, the Kenyan-specific features are genuinely strong, and the field-mode UX is excellent. However, the app has **critical correctness bugs** (broken datum transform, broken M-Pesa callback, broken points API), **critical security gaps** (sync impersonation, unused audit chain, disabled RLS), and **critical data integrity failures** (no CRS/accuracy/provenance per coordinate, no organizations table, hardcoded CRS in legal documents).

**Bottom line:** These are fixable problems. The architecture is sound, the team clearly understands the domain, and the infrastructure (hash-chain audit, RDM 1.1 standards, ArdhiSasa client, Form No. 4 generator) is real — it's just not wired together consistently. A focused 4-6 week effort on Phases 1-3 above would transform this from "ambitious prototype" to "professional-grade surveying platform."

The app is **not yet excellent**. It has the potential to be. Fix the critical issues first.
