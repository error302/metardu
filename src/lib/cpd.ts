/**
 * AUDIT FIX (2026-07-05): Fraud prevention overhaul.
 *
 * Changes:
 *   1. awardCPDPoints now checks for duplicate reference_id before inserting
 *      (prevents double-awarding from retry clicks or race conditions)
 *   2. Manual entries (TRAINING_COMPLETED, CONFERENCE_ATTENDED, MANUAL_ENTRY)
 *      are created with approved=FALSE — they don't count toward the total
 *      until an admin approves them
 *   3. System-generated entries (PEER_REVIEW_COMPLETED, JOB_COMPLETED, etc.)
 *      are created with approved=TRUE — they count immediately
 *   4. getTotalCPDForYear now only sums APPROVED records
 *   5. New functions: addManualCPDEntry, approveCPDEntry, rejectCPDEntry,
 *      getPendingCPDEntries (for admin review)
 *   6. Annual cap: 100 points/year (ISK requires 20; 100 is generous)
