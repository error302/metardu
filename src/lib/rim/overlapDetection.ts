/**
 * RIM Overlap Detection
 * =====================
 *
 * Detects boundary overlaps between a new survey parcel and existing
 * parcels on the same Registry Index Map (RIM) sheet. ArdhiSasa
 * rejects overlapping parcels; catching this in-office saves a
 * rejection cycle.
 *
 * How it works
 * ------------
 * Given a new parcel's vertices and a list of existing parcels (from
 * the RIM database, filtered by map sheet), compute the geometric
 * intersection of the new parcel with each existing one. If any
 * intersection has non-zero area, it's an overlap.
 *
 * The actual geometry uses turf's intersect() via turfHelpers.ts.
 * This module wraps it with survey-specific logic:
 *   - Filter by map sheet (parcels on different sheets can't overlap)
 *   - Report overlap area + percentage of the new parcel
 *   - Threshold: any overlap > 0.01 m² is flagged (sub-centimeter
 *     overlaps are numerical noise, not real conflicts)
 *
 * Integration
 * -----------
 * - Statutory gate: a new rule 'ardhisasa.rim_overlap' blocks
 *   submission if any overlap is detected
 * - UI: a pre-submission check button on the submission page calls
 *   /api/rim/overlap-check to show overlaps before export
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *   import { detectOverlaps } from '@/lib/rim/overlapDetection'
 *
 *   const result = await detectOverlaps({
 *     newParcel: { parcelNumber: 'LR 123/456', vertices: [...] },
 *     existingParcels: [
 *       { parcelNumber: 'LR 123/455', vertices: [...] },
 *       { parcelNumber: 'LR 123/457', vertices: [...] },
 *     ],
 *   })
 *
 *   if (result.hasOverlaps) {
 *     for (const overlap of result.overlaps) {
 *       console.warn(`${overlap.existingParcelNumber}: ${overlap.overlapAreaSqm.toFixed(1)} m²`)
 *     }
 *   }
