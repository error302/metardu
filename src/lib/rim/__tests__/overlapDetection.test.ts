/**
 * Integration tests for RIM overlap detection using the REAL geospatial stack.
 *
 * These tests deliberately do NOT mock @turf/turf or proj4. The unit suites
 * (turfHelpers.test.ts, topologyChecker.test.ts) mock both, so they cannot
 * catch API-contract regressions like turf 7's intersect()/difference()
 * taking a single FeatureCollection — the old two-argument call silently
 * ignored the second polygon, so overlap checks never fired. The disjoint
 * case below is the regression guard: under the old bug it would report an
 * overlap (a parcel intersects itself) and fail. Running the real
 * lazy-loaded turf + proj4 pipeline end-to-end locks the fix in at the
 * overlapDetection level.
 *
 * Coordinates are simple Kenya UTM 37S squares (EPSG:21037, the default the
 * helpers use), so the transform stays lightweight while still exercising the
 * full UTM → WGS84 → turf → UTM round-trip.
