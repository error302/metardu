Before measuring anything, walk the site.

Why we do this:
You need to see all stations clearly from 
each other. If two stations can't see each 
other, your traverse won't work.

Checklist:
□ Walk between each planned station
□ Confirm clear line of sight
□ Note any obstacles
□ Mark station positions with pegs or paint

Common mistake:
Choosing stations behind trees or buildings
where the instrument can't see the next point.`,

You must start from at least 2 known points.

Why we do this:
Without known control points your survey
has no reference. It floats in space.

What you need:
• Opening control point (known E, N)
• Closing control point (different known E, N)
• Known bearing between them

In GeoNova:
→ Go to your project
→ Add both control points
→ Mark them as Primary Control
→ Lock them so they can't be moved`,

✓ Grades the traverse

Acceptable precision (Basak standards):
