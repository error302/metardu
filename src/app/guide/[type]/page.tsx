        title: 'Reconnaissance',
        juniorContent: `STEP 1 — RECONNAISSANCE (FIELD SOP)
Goal: design a traverse that can be observed cleanly, checked on-site, and will close.

Minimum equipment (trainee-safe):
• Total station + tribrach + tripod (spikes working)
• Prism + pole + bipod (stable)
• Plumb bob / optical plummet, rod bubble
• Pegs/nails/paint + hammer + marker
• Field book (or GeoNova Field Mode) + backup pen
• Tape (for short ties), machete/brush cutter if needed
• PPE: boots, vest, helmet if construction site

Recon rules (do NOT skip):
1) Walk the whole polygon route.
2) Confirm intervisibility: every station must see the next AND previous station.
3) Choose stable stations: firm ground, not loose soil, not on traffic/vibration, not on manhole covers.
4) Avoid bad geometry: very short legs mixed with very long legs; keep legs “reasonable” and balanced.
5) Plan closure: close back to start OR to a different known control point (preferred for a stronger check).
6) Identify recovery: record a witness tie for each station (e.g., “0.80 m to tree”, “1.20 m to wall corner”).

Booking template (copy into field book):
Station | BS To | FS To | FL Angle | FR Angle | Slope Dist | Vert Angle | HI | HR | Notes

        title: 'Establish Control',
        juniorContent: `STEP 2 — ESTABLISH CONTROL (FIELD SOP)
Control is the foundation. If control is wrong, every coordinate you produce is wrong.

Minimum control requirement (trainee-safe):
• At least TWO known points (different coordinates)
• Their IDs must match what is on the ground (beacon ID / BM name / peg label)
• Your project coordinate system must be explicit: UTM zone + hemisphere + datum (WGS84/Local)

Control verification procedure:
1) Recover control physically (find the mark, not just “near it”).
2) Photograph the mark and its surroundings.
3) Take a short witness tie (offsets to nearby permanent features).
4) Check the control pair:
   • Measure distance and bearing between the two control points (one quick setup is enough).
   • If the measured check is inconsistent with expected values (or differs unreasonably), STOP.

If control comes from GNSS today:
• Confirm fix quality (RTK FIX vs FLOAT), PDOP, and occupation time.
• Re-observe at least once (repeat occupation) if the job is cadastral/engineering.

GeoNova setup:
→ Project Settings: confirm UTM zone + hemisphere
→ Add both control points as Primary Control
→ Lock them (prevents accidental edits)

        juniorContent: `STEP 3 — SET UP INSTRUMENT (FIELD SOP)
Objective: occupy the correct station, centered and leveled, with known HI/HR and correct EDM settings.

Setup sequence (do in this order):
1) Tripod: legs firm, head roughly level, station mark centered under head.
2) Mount instrument + tribrach; lock lightly.
3) Centering: optical plummet/plumb bob to station mark (fine adjust).
4) Leveling: circular bubble → plate bubble → electronic level (fine).
5) Re-check centering AFTER leveling (leveling often shifts centering).
6) Record HI (instrument height) to 0.001 m if possible.
7) Prism: confirm HR (prism height), prism constant, and target type.
8) Instrument settings: units = meters; angles = DMS; EDM mode correct (prism/reflectorless); apply met corrections if used.

Quick “orientation sanity” before observing:
• Sight the backsight point. Confirm the point ID and that it is stable.
• Set/record your reference: either set Hz = 0°00'00" on backsight OR record the backsight bearing explicitly.

Trainee stop gate:
If you cannot keep the bubble centered through a full rotation, or centering keeps drifting, STOP (tripod not stable / legs sinking).`,

        title: 'Measure Observations',
        juniorContent: `STEP 4 — MEASURE OBSERVATIONS (FIELD SOP)
At every station, your job is to produce reliable angles + distances with redundancy.

Station observing pattern (recommended):
1) Set up on station i (HI recorded).
2) Backsight to station i−1 (confirm ID). Set Hz reference (0°00'00") OR record the backsight bearing.
3) Foresight to station i+1 (confirm ID). Observe:
   • Horizontal angle
   • Distance (prefer horizontal distance; if slope distance is recorded, record vertical angle too)
4) Repeat as a set:
   • Face Left (FL) + Face Right (FR), or two full sets if instrument is simple.

Distance handling (trainee-safe):
• If your total station shows BOTH slope and horizontal distance, book the horizontal distance for traverse.
• If you only have slope distance, you MUST record vertical angle and reduce to horizontal (do not ignore).

Field tolerances (set your job tolerance before starting):
• FL vs FR angle difference: re-observe if outside your tolerance (example: 20″).
• Distance repeats: re-measure if outside instrument spec (example: > (2 mm + 2 ppm × D)).
• If backsight is disturbed (person kicks peg / prism moved), redo the station immediately.

Angular check (do this BEFORE leaving site):
• If you observed included angles for an n-sided closed traverse:
  Theoretical sum = (n − 2) × 180°
  Allowable misclosure (Basak) = ±1' √n
• If the misclosure exceeds the limit: find the problem station and re-observe (do not wait for office).

GeoNova entry tip:
If you enter bearings/distances (instead of raw angles), ensure your bearings are Whole Circle Bearings (0–360°) and consistent with your backsight reference.`,

        title: 'Compute Traverse',
        juniorContent: `STEP 5 — COMPUTE + QUALITY CHECK (FIELD/Office SOP)
GeoNova computes the traverse and tells you whether it is acceptable.

GeoNova computes:
✓ Latitude/Departure per leg (Lat = D×cos(WCB), Dep = D×sin(WCB))
✓ Closing error (ΔE, ΔN) and linear misclosure
✓ Relative precision ratio (Total traverse length / Misclosure)
✓ Bowditch corrections per Basak:
  corrE = -(legD/totalD) × closingErrorE
  corrN = -(legD/totalD) × closingErrorN
✓ Adjusted coordinates + Gale’s Table output

Acceptance gates (Basak):
• Urban cadastral:  ≥ 1:5000
• Suburban:         ≥ 1:3000
• Rural:            ≥ 1:1000

If precision is POOR (trainee workflow):
1) Check for “obvious” blunders:
   • Wrong station ID / swapped from-to
   • Wrong face reading typed
   • Wrong HI/HR or prism constant
   • Decimal point error on distance
2) Look at corrections per leg:
   • If one leg correction is > 3× average, suspect that leg first.
3) Re-observe the suspect station/leg immediately (best), then re-run.

Hard stop rules:
• Precision < 1:1000 after re-observation → reject and redesign/re-observe.
• Angular check exceeds ±1'√n and cannot be isolated → re-observe angles.
• Closing to a known point fails significantly (link traverse) → control or orientation problem.`,

Goal: transfer RLs with a closed check and a passing arithmetic check.

Minimum equipment:
• Automatic/digital level + tripod (or total station in leveling mode)
• 2 staffs if possible (faster and safer), with rod bubbles
• Turning point plate (or solid peg) + chalk/marker
• Field book (or GeoNova Field Mode) + backup pen

Before you start (trainee rule):
If instrument collimation is unknown OR the job is important → do a Two Peg Test first.
If Two Peg Test fails, STOP and rectify instrument (otherwise your RLs will be biased).

Plan your route:
1) Identify the starting benchmark (BM) with known RL.
2) Identify the closing BM (same BM loop closure is best) OR a second known BM.
3) Choose turning points (TPs):
   • every ~50–80 m (or as terrain demands)

Setup objective: balanced sights + stable instrument = reliable RL transfer.

Setup rules (Basak/standard practice):
• Set instrument roughly midway between BS and FS points (BS ≈ FS distance).
• Keep BS−FS distance difference within ~10 m (tighter for high precision).
• Avoid very long sights; keep individual sights reasonable for conditions (often ≤ 60–80 m; avoid >100 m if possible).
• Avoid long sights over hot surfaces (tar roads) to reduce shimmer/refraction.
• Tripod legs firm; instrument level stable through rotation.

Trainee workflow at each setup:
1) Choose a stable spot with clear sight to BS and FS.
2) Level the instrument properly.
3) Focus eyepiece (remove parallax) before reading staff.
4) Take BS first, then FS (consistent pattern reduces mistakes).

        title: 'Take Readings',
        juniorContent: `STEP 3 — TAKE READINGS (FIELD SOP)
At each instrument setup, you will record BS/IS/FS in a strict pattern.

Recommended reading pattern:
1) BS to known point or TP (call-and-repeat; book immediately).
2) Any IS readings (if you need intermediate points).
3) FS to next TP (call-and-repeat; book immediately).
4) Move instrument; the FS point becomes the next setup’s BS point.

Staff handling rules:
• Staff MUST be vertical (use rod bubble; rock the staff to find minimum reading if needed).
• Book to 0.001 m (3 decimals) consistently.
• Do not “correct” readings later — re-read in the moment if unsure.

Turning point (TP) rules:
• Use a TP plate or solid point (concrete/rock/firm peg).
• Mark and witness the TP location; do not change it between BS and FS.
• Never use loose stones, soft soil, or vibrating surfaces (vehicles/construction).

Quick sanity check at each setup:
• Rise/Fall = BS − FS (for that setup). If it looks unreasonable, re-check immediately.

Enter the leveling data and DO NOT accept results until checks pass.

GeoNova enforces Basak arithmetic check:
ΣBS − ΣFS MUST equal (Last RL − First RL).
If this fails: treat it as an error, not “close enough”.

If arithmetic check FAILS (blunder isolation):
1) Check for transcription errors (digit swap, wrong station line, wrong column).
2) Check that each TP appears twice correctly (FS then next BS).
3) Re-check staff units and decimal places.
4) If still failing, re-run the affected section in the field.

If arithmetic check PASSES:
• Check closing error against allowable tolerance (±12 √K mm ordinary).
• If out of tolerance: shorten sights, rebalance BS/FS, avoid heat shimmer, and re-run the section.

• Title deed / registry extract (parcel ID, owner, acreage/area)
• Survey plan / mutation / deed plan (bearings, distances, monument descriptions)
• Any coordinates list (beacons/control) and datum/projection notes
• Adjacent parcel IDs and any easements/road reserves

Desk checks (trainee-safe):
1) Confirm you have the correct parcel ID and correct edition/date of plan.
2) Note the monument types required by your jurisdiction (material, depth, witness marks).
3) Identify key “legal lines” (road boundaries, rivers, easements) that must be respected.
4) Prepare a corner schedule: corner IDs (P1…Pn), expected bearings/distances, expected area.

Training rule:
If evidence is unclear or the case is disputed, do NOT “guess” corners. Document and escalate early.`,

        juniorContent: `STEP 2 — LOCATE EXISTING MONUMENTS (FIELD SOP)
Your job is to recover evidence first. Reinstatement comes after evidence + checks.

Search for:
• Iron pin / rebar, concrete beacon, stone mark, old pegs
• Fence corners, hedge lines, old boundary trenches (supporting evidence)
• Reference marks described on the plan (trees, buildings, culverts)

Evidence capture routine (repeat for each found mark):
1) Confirm the mark type matches the plan description (if provided).
2) Photograph close-up and context (include a scale if possible).
3) Describe it: material, condition, any stamps/IDs.
4) Record witness ties: at least two offsets to permanent features.
5) Add it to GeoNova as a control point and LOCK it.

Conflict handling (trainee-safe):
• If two monuments claim the same corner OR evidence conflicts:
  - do NOT choose one arbitrarily
  - document both, take ties, and escalate

Hard stop rules:
• Adjoining owner disputes the line or refuses access.
• Conflicting monuments cannot be resolved by checks.
• You cannot connect the recovered evidence to reliable control.`,

You must connect all recovered corners/monuments into one consistent control framework.

Traverse strategy (recommended):
• Start from reliable control.
• Observe around the parcel connecting each corner.
• Close back to start OR to a second known control point (stronger check).

Quality requirements (Basak):
• Angles: observe FL/FR (or repeated sets).
• Perform angular check (±1' √n) before leaving.
• Precision target for boundary work: aim ≥ 1:5000 (or jurisdiction requirement).

Trainee tip:
Use consistent corner naming from the plan (P1, P2, …) to avoid legal confusion later.

• Area vs registered area (coordinate area after adjustment)

When differences appear (trainee-safe workflow):
1) Verify you used the correct parcel documents (ID + edition/date).
